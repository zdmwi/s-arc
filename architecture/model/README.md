# Model

The models in ths folder are created using the [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) 
diagramming and charting tool. Mermaid allows us to create and maintain our diagrams in markdown 
code-blocks while being automatically rendered for us in apps like github and gitlab since they support 
markdown natively.

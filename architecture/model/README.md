# Model

The models in the `src` folder are created using [PlantUML](). Specifically, the 
[C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML) version. The `diagrams` folder 
contains markdown files with source blocks containing the corresponding PlantUML code. These 
markdown files are generated by a script from the existing PlantUML files in `src`. Github has 
native support for displaying PlantUML diagrams in markdown so we exploit that here.

## Creating new diagrams

1. Create a new `.puml` file in the `src` directory.
1. Write the PlantUML specifications.
1. Execute the generate-diagrams.sh script to generate the corresponding diagrams to the `diagrams`
directory.

## Updating existing diagrams 
1. Make the necessary changes to the `.puml` file in the src directory.
1. Execute the generate-diagrams.sh script to get the markdown diagram.

# Model

The models in the `src` folder are created using [Mermaid](). The `diagrams` folder 
contains markdown files with source blocks containing the corresponding Mermaid code. These 
markdown files are generated by a script from the existing Mermaid files in `src`. Github has 
native support for displaying Mermaid diagrams in markdown so we exploit that here.

## Creating new diagrams

1. Create a new `.mmd` file in the `src` directory.
1. Write the Mermaid C4 specifications.
1. Execute the generate-diagrams.sh script to generate the corresponding diagrams to the `diagrams`
directory.

## Updating existing diagrams 
1. Make the necessary changes to the `.mmd` file in the src directory.
1. Execute the generate-diagrams.sh script to get the markdown diagram.

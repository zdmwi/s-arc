# Model

Models are managed using the Structurizr DSL. The `workspace.dsl` file in the `diagrams` folder has the 
code describing the C4 Architecture of the system. 

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker compose installed.
1. Use the docker-compose.yml file to start Structurizr Lite via `docker compose up`

## Making changes to the model

All changes are made to `workspace.dsl` using the Structurizr DSL language. There is no hot reloading
so to see the changes reflected you need to refresh the page.
